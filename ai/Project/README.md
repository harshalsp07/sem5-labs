# 🎲 Monopoly AI — Expectiminimax Game Engine & 3D Visualizer

An intelligent, state-of-the-art Monopoly-style board game engine built with **Three.js 3D WebGL**, interactive **Expectiminimax Game Tree Search**, dynamic strategy adaptation, and an in-browser **AI Training & Benchmark Studio**.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. 🧠 Expectiminimax Game Tree AI
- **Game Tree Architecture**:
  - **MAX Nodes (AI Turn)**: Evaluates all candidate actions (Buy Property, Pass, Build Houses/Hotels, Mortgage/Unmortgage, Jail Strategy, Trade Proposals).
  - **CHANCE Nodes (Dice Rolls & Cards)**: Models the exact binomial probability distribution of 2d6 dice rolls ($P(d) = \frac{6 - |7 - d|}{36}$ for rolls $2$ through $12$) to calculate expected values across all possible future positions.
  - **MIN Nodes (Opponent Responses)**: Simulates opponent counter-actions and future rent payments.
- **Dynamic Heuristic Evaluation $V(s)$**:
  $$V(s) = w_1 \cdot \text{Cash} + w_2 \cdot \text{PropEquity} + w_3 \cdot \text{MonopolyBonus} + w_4 \cdot \text{HouseROI} + w_5 \cdot \mathbb{E}[\text{Income}] - w_6 \cdot \mathbb{E}[\text{Hazard}] - w_7 \cdot \text{BankruptcyRisk}$$
- **Adaptive Strategic Phases**:
  - **Early Game (Land Grab)**: High weight on acquiring any unowned property; jail is penalizing (rush to exit).
  - **Mid Game (Monopoly Assembly)**: High priority on completing color sets and reaching 3 houses (the optimal Monopoly ROI sweet spot).
  - **Late Game (Survival & Minefield)**: High liquidity safety buffer; jail becomes a safe sanctuary to avoid opponent hotels!

### 2. 🌳 Real-Time Decision Tree Visualizer
- An interactive, live **Canvas-based Game Tree Visualizer** in the sidebar.
- Displays root decision state $\rightarrow$ Action branches $\rightarrow$ Chance dice outcomes $\rightarrow$ Leaf evaluations.
- Highlights the optimal branch chosen by Expectiminimax in glowing emerald green with exact expected value deltas and mathematical reasoning!

### 3. 🎨 High-Fidelity 3D Board (Three.js) & 2D Classic Toggle
- **3D WebGL Viewport**:
  - Vintage felt & mahogany beveled board with procedural textures and crisp color banners.
  - Distinct metallic luxury player tokens (Top Hat, Roadster Car, Battleship, Classic Pawn).
  - Smooth multi-step **hopping animations** around board corners with parabolic jumping physics.
  - 3D tumbling dice rolls that spin, bounce, and settle flat on the rolled pips.
  - Real 3D green cottages and red hotels rendered on deeds upon upgrade.
  - Smooth orbit camera with Isometric 3D, Top-Down Tactical, and Follow-Pawn modes.
- **2D Classic Grid Toggle**:
  - Seamless 1-click switch to a responsive 11x11 classic grid view.

### 4. 🧬 AI Training & Benchmark Studio (AI Lab)
- **Headless Tournament Benchmark**:
  - Simulates 20, 50, or 100 fast-forward matches without animation latency in seconds.
  - Compares win rates, average turns to bankruptcy, and average final net worth.
- **Genetic Algorithm Training**:
  - Population-based weight evolution across generations through self-play tournament selection.
- **Manual Weight Sliders**:
  - Tweak liquidity preference, monopoly bonus, house ROI, and hazard avoidance in real-time.

### 5. 🤝 Property Deeds & Trade Negotiation
- Click any 3D or 2D tile to inspect the **Title Deed** with full rent breakdown and direct management (Build, Sell, Mortgage, Unmortgage).
- Propose trades to AI agents (cash and properties). The AI uses Expectiminimax to evaluate whether the proposal increases its expected game outcome.

### 6. 🔊 Synthesized Web Audio API Sound Effects
- Pure browser Web Audio synthesis: dice shakes, cash register chimes, hammer taps, jail door clanks, and victory fanfares without any external asset dependencies.
